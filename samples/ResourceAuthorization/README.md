# Resource Authorization

## Login

There are different users: admin, test1, test2, test3, stranger1, all users have `test` password.

## Use Cases

### Only users with roles - Admin or Reader can access workspace functionality

* Implement based on Protected Resource "workspaces"
* Implement based on RealRoles from Claims

### Admin can manage workspaces

* Showcase how to apply resource-type policies.

### Users can list names of all workspaces

* Showcase policies for particular resource "Workspaces".

### A member of workspace can see workspace details

### A member of workspace can see other members

### Unauthorized users can access to public workspace

* We want to show that `AllowAnonymous` impacts `ProtectedResource` and takes precedence.
