# OpenAPI Support <Badge type="warning" text="preview" />

From Keycloak documentation:

> The OpenAPI definitions are a feature that is currently in preview. Please provide your feedback by [joining this discussion](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/8898) while weâ€™re continuing to work on this. If you find something is outdated or wrong, create a GitHub issue and provide a pull request.

It means we can use OpenAPI definitions to generate full-fledged API.
